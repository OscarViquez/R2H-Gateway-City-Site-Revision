### The Process: Design
I decided to fully redesign my gateway project. I wanted to make my website look like a legitimate website.
 Something a person or business would pay if they asked me to build one.

I looked into websites like Airbnb and Trip Advisors to look how their information is laid out. As they are travel websites and are probably using best practices when it comes with design. I also looked for new pictures to add to the website to make it stand out a bit. Used Adobe Photoshop to crop or change the look of certain images.

I used Figma (https://www.figma.com/design/) to lay out the design before coding it out.
so I can just focus on accessibilty and semantic html structure when I start coding.
